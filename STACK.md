# STACK.md — the canonical stack reference

The **as-built, locked stack** of `replay-engine`, and the stack contract for every repo
that consumes it: `tekken-replay-database`, `replaydatabase-shell`, and the
`2xko-replay-database` modernization (PLAN §0/§6.3a). Where `PLAN.md` and this file differ
on stack details — versions, file locations, delivery mechanisms — **this file wins**
(PLAN §5 says the same). Architecture, phases, and product decisions stay in `PLAN.md`.

Update this file in the same commit as any dependency bump or convention change.

## 1. Locked stack

Verified working together on **Node v24.16.0 / npm 11.13.0** (WSL2 Linux). Exact resolved
versions from `package-lock.json` (ranges in `package.json` are caret; the lockfile pins
builds; this table records the tested truth):

### Runtime `dependencies`

Kept deliberately minimal — git-layer consumers install these, so nothing dev-shaped
belongs here.

| Package                  | Version | Role                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tailwindcss`            | 4.3.2   | Tailwind **v4**, CSS-first `@theme` (the theming foundation)                                                                                      |
| `@tailwindcss/vite`      | 4.3.2   | Official first-party Vite plugin — the ONLY Tailwind module                                                                                       |
| `ufo`                    | 1.6.4   | `withBase` / `joinURL` — every absolute URL goes through it                                                                                       |
| `animejs`                | 4.5.0   | Chart reveals (v4 **named-export** API: `import { animate, stagger }` — never the v3 default import); dynamically imported so it stays out of SSR |
| `@vercel/analytics`      | 2.0.1   | Web analytics Nuxt module, hoisted engine-wide (no-ops off-Vercel)                                                                                |
| `@vercel/speed-insights` | 2.0.0   | CWV reporting via the engine's client plugin (sampleRate 0.5)                                                                                     |

The two `@vercel/*` packages peer-declare `vue-router ^4` while Nuxt 4 ships v5 (runtime
compatible — the live 2XKO deployment proves it). The engine's `package.json` carries an
`overrides` block pinning their `vue-router` peer to `^5`; **overrides don't propagate**,
so every consuming repo replicates those 6 lines (part of the §1 replication contract).

| `@types/node`                         | 24.13.3 | Required — without it the generated `tsconfig.node.json` has empty `types` and `node:*` imports fail. Pinned `^24` to match the tested Node 24 runtime (types a major ahead permit phantom APIs) |

**Not in the stack, on purpose:** Pinia (PLAN §0), `@nuxtjs/tailwindcss` (v3-locked — see
§4), `@nuxtjs/google-fonts` (replaced by fontsource/Vite assets), any test framework
beyond the node-driven scripts (revisit when Phase 2 grows real component logic).

### Version policy

- Game repos align to these versions when they adopt the engine (2XKO modernization
  explicitly rides this table, PLAN §6.3a).
- Bumps happen in the engine first and get verified by `typecheck`, `lint`,
  `test:filters`, and the browser suites, then propagate to games via the engine pin bump.

### Node version policy

- **Runtime = the newest major that is both Active LTS and available for Vercel builds**
  (currently **24**; `engines.node: ">=24 <25"` in package.json).
- `@types/node` always tracks the runtime major (types a major ahead permit phantom APIs).
- Bumps happen engine-first with the `engines.node` field updated and the full gate
  battery re-verified (positive controls included), then propagate via the engine pin.

## 2. Delivery mechanisms (how each piece is wired)

### Tailwind v4 — via `@tailwindcss/vite` through a `vite:extendConfig` hook

`@nuxtjs/tailwindcss@6` (latest) pins `tailwindcss ~3.4.17` and **cannot run v4** or its
CSS-first `@theme`; the override architecture (games shadow engine tokens) requires v4.
(`@theme` is engine-internal: it compiles only inside the engine's own CSS graph below.
App theme files shadow with plain unlayered `:root`, never `@theme` — §5.13.)
The engine registers the official Vite plugin in `nuxt.config.ts`:

```ts
hooks: {
  'vite:extendConfig'(viteConfig) {
    const cfg = viteConfig as import('vite').UserConfig; // Nuxt types plugins readonly
    cfg.plugins = [...(cfg.plugins ?? []), tailwindcss()];
  },
},
```

The hook (rather than a `vite.plugins` array entry) survives layer merging — consuming
apps inherit it and must **not** add any Tailwind module themselves. CSS entry:
`tailwind/index.css` (`@import 'tailwindcss'` → `@source '../app'` → `structural.css` →
`theme-default.css`), registered with an absolute path computed from the engine's
`import.meta.url` so it resolves from any rootDir.

### Fonts — committed, Vite-processed assets (never `public/` URLs)

- **Engine (neutral faces):** `woff2` + OFL licenses **committed** in `tailwind/fonts/`,
  referenced from `theme-default.css` with **relative** `url()`s → Vite emits hashed,
  base-path-safe assets. Committed because git-layer consumers prune the engine's
  devDependencies (§5) — an install-time copy from `@fontsource-*` would leave consumers
  without fonts and break their builds. Refresh deliberately via `npm run fonts:update`.
- **Game apps:** normal npm installs, so they may either depend on `@fontsource-*`
  packages directly and import them in `app/assets/theme.css`, or commit `woff2` next to
  the CSS the same way — both are Vite-processed. What they must never do: reference
  fonts as absolute `/fonts/*` from `public/` (§5, CSS `url()` constraint).

### Registry provisioning (PLAN §2.4 as amended — landed in Phase 2)

- **API:** a game app statically imports its small registries and calls
  `provideRegistries({ characters, players, stats })` (engine util, auto-imported)
  from a normal app plugin (`app/plugins/registries.ts`). Arrays or id-keyed records
  both accepted; the holder is module-scope (registries are constant per app).
- Engine composables (`useCharacters` / `usePlayers` / `useStats`) consume
  **provided-first** and fall back to a client fetch of `/data/*.json` only when nothing
  was provided. `useReplays()` is ALWAYS `server:false` from `public/data/replays.json`.
- Provided data is synchronously available during SSR/prerender → registry pages emit
  real HTML with data-derived titles (the SEO requirement), with no payload
  serialization and no hydration drift (client bundles the identical import).
- Pure-core semantics unit-tested in `scripts/test-registry.mjs`; `/health` shows each
  collection's provisioning path. The fixtures app provisions exactly like a real game.

### Game-panel extension slots (PLAN §11 "game-specific stat systems")

- The engine ships **empty** `GameStatsPanels.vue` (stats page; receives `patch`) and
  `GameCharacterPanels.vue` (character page; receives `characterId`). A game injects its
  own panels by shipping components at the SAME path — Nuxt layer precedence resolves the
  app's copy over the engine's. No registry, no config: the override mechanism already
  used for per-game flourishes (PLAN §4b). Fixtures prove it with a dummy panel; 2XKO's
  fuse panels are the first real consumers (Phase 3).

### Static build artifacts (modules/static-artifacts.ts)

- Every generated site inherits: `sitemap.xml` (from the ACTUAL prerendered route list,
  path routes only, `/health` + `/not-found` excluded, base-prefixed), `robots.txt`,
  `manifest.webmanifest` (GameConfig name/short_name/colors + base-correct icons), and
  the **designed 404** — the prerendered `/not-found` page copied over nitro's SPA
  fallback `404.html`, content-checked against the NotFoundContent marker ("No data at
  this route") so a silent regression fails the build. Zero per-app scripting (replaces
  the shipped repo's `build:before` sitemap hook + postgenerate script).

### TypeScript — canonical base + two-root project-references typecheck

- `tsconfig.base.json` — the canonical strictness baseline (`strict`,
  `forceConsistentCasingInFileNames`, `skipLibCheck`, `noEmit`). Game repos replicate or
  extend it; the engine's copy is canonical.
- Root `tsconfig.json` and `fixtures/tsconfig.json` extend the base and hold **only**
  project references to the Nuxt-4 generated contexts (`.nuxt/tsconfig.{app,node,shared}.json`).
- `npm run typecheck` = `nuxt prepare && nuxt typecheck && nuxt typecheck fixtures` —
  the second root re-checks all engine code **as consumed through the layer** (the same
  shape every game gets). Game repos run the same pattern against their own root.

### Lint / format — `@nuxt/eslint` flat config + Prettier

- `'@nuxt/eslint'` is in the **engine's** `modules`, so every consuming app inherits it;
  each repo's `nuxt prepare` generates its project-aware `./.nuxt/eslint.config.mjs`.
- Repo-root `eslint.config.mjs` = `withNuxt(…overrides, eslintConfigPrettier)` with
  `eslint-config-prettier` **last**. ESLint owns correctness; Prettier owns formatting
  (no stylistic ESLint rules). Game repos replicate this file verbatim.
- `.prettierrc`: `{ semi: true, singleQuote: true, trailingComma: "all", printWidth: 100, singleAttributePerLine: true }`.
  `.prettierignore` excludes generated output, binaries, `public/`, `design/`, and
  **`PLAN.md`** (hand-authored; never machine-reflowed).
- Convention surfaced by lint: `vue/multi-word-component-names` is enforced — brand
  components use the `Brand*` prefix (`BrandWordmark`; Phase 2 adds `BrandMark`,
  `BrandSpinner`, `BrandLogo` per PLAN §5).
- **SFC authoring order (set 2026-07-18):** every `.vue` file is **template-first** —
  `<template>` → `<script setup lang="ts">` → `<style scoped>`. `singleAttributePerLine`
  then breaks every multi-attribute tag one-attribute-per-line (single/no-attribute tags
  stay inline). Applied engine-wide; **consuming repos replicate `.prettierrc` and this
  block order verbatim** so cross-repo diffs stay clean.

### Scripts (the canonical set)

| Script                                   | What it does                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dev` / `build` / `generate` / `preview` | Run against **`fixtures/`** — the thin consuming app (`extends: ['..']`)                                                              |
| `typecheck`                              | Two-root `vue-tsc` check (see above)                                                                                                  |
| `lint` / `lint:fix`                      | `nuxt prepare && eslint .` (prepare guarantees the generated config exists)                                                           |
| `format` / `format:check`                | Prettier across the repo                                                                                                              |
| `test:filters`                           | Pure-logic filter semantics (facets, search, sort) against the fixture dataset                                                        |
| `test:registry`                          | Registry-provisioning store semantics incl. the fetch-fallback (unprovided) state                                                     |
| `fonts:update`                           | Refresh committed neutral fonts from `@fontsource-*`                                                                                  |
| `scripts/fixtures-data.mjs`              | Derives fixture stats.json from replays (pipeline parity); `--1v1` emits the rank-ladder variant                                      |
| `scripts/verify-phase2.mjs`              | Full ported-UI click-through (47 checks: filters/matchup/search/sort/modal/drawer/stats/404/SEO/network/reduced-motion/manifest)      |

| `scripts/verify-subpath.mjs`             | Base-path resilience probe — asserts no request escapes the base                                                                      |
| `scripts/verify-override.mjs`            | Theme-override gate on the BUILT fixture bundle, both directions (`:root` override wins / removal → umbrella) + raw-`@theme` tripwire |

SSG: `nitro.preset = 'vercel-static'`, `prerender.crawlLinks = true`; output lands in
`fixtures/.vercel/output/static` (games: their own `.vercel/output`).

## 3. Nuxt 4 layout conventions

- **`app/` is the srcDir.** `app.config.ts` lives at **`app/app.config.ts`** — a
  root-level `app.config.ts` is **silently ignored** (verify pickup via the import in
  `.nuxt/app.config.mjs`). PLAN §5 trees reflect this; older Nuxt-3-style diagrams do not.
- **Layer anatomy:** `$meta.name: 'replay-engine'`; the `@engine` alias pinned via
  `fileURLToPath(new URL('.', import.meta.url))` so engine code never self-references
  through `~~/` (which resolves to the _consumer's_ rootDir under a layer); CSS entry by
  absolute path for the same reason. Engine-internal imports (composables/utils/types,
  including cross-`app/` type imports) go through **`@engine/…`** (e.g.
  `@engine/app/composables/useStatsRows`) — never relative `../` or `@`/`~`, which
  mis-resolve to the consumer's srcDir under a layer.
- **`fixtures/` is a real consuming app**, not a data-copy step: its own
  `fixtures/app/app.config.ts` (`charactersPerSide: 2`, `coOccurrence: true`) merges over
  the engine default (`1`, `false`) through the exact mechanism a game uses. Engine dev is
  therefore always exercising the layer contract.
- **`public/` is inherited** by consumers (favicon + icon set ship from the engine; a game
  overrides by shipping the same filenames). Verified for the **local-path** layer
  (`ENGINE_PATH` / `extends: ['..']`); the **remote** (`github:`) layer case gets
  re-verified on the Phase 3 preview deploy before it's relied on in prod.
- **Data flow (Phase-1 as-built):** all collections client-fetched (`server: false`)
  through `useDataUrl()` → `withBase()`. Per updated PLAN §2.4, Phase 2 adds the registry
  **provisioning API** (bundled registries for prerendered SEO); the client fetch then
  remains as the standalone/fixture fallback. Client-only result subtrees sit inside
  `<ClientOnly>` (see §5, hydration).

---

## 4. Why not `@nuxtjs/tailwindcss` (and other rejections)

- **`@nuxtjs/tailwindcss@6.14`** ships `tailwindcss ~3.4.17`. Tailwind v3 has no CSS-first
  `@theme`, so game re-skins by CSS shadowing would be impossible. Rejected; do not add it
  to any repo in the platform (the 2XKO modernization removes it).
- **`@nuxtjs/google-fonts`** — replaced by fontsource/committed Vite assets (no gstatic,
  base-path-safe, no runtime module).
- **Pinia** — not used anywhere in the platform; URL query + composables carry all state.

---

## 5. Standing empirical constraints (violations fail silently — treat as MUSTs)

1. **Tailwind v4 motion namespace is `--transition-duration-*`.** A `--duration-*` token
   is in an unknown namespace: v4 **drops it silently** and `duration-*` utilities fall
   back to the 150ms default. (`--ease-*`, `--radius-*`, `--shadow-*`, `--text-*` +
   `--text-*--line-height`, `--tracking-*`, `--leading-*`, `--font-weight-*` are real
   namespaces.) Utility classes stay `duration-fast` etc.
2. **Prerender seeds must be pushed on `nitro:init`**, base-prefixed:
   `nitro.options.prerender.routes.push(joinURL(nuxt.options.app.baseURL, route))` (the
   engine's `enginePrerenderSeeds` inline module). There is **no `prerender:routes` Nuxt
   hook** in Nuxt 4.4, and static `prerender.routes` arrays are not auto-prefixed — under
   a subpath they 404 the build.
3. **`NUXT_APP_BASE_URL` alone is runtime-only.** For SSG it desyncs the router from
   build-time asset paths and prerender seeds. The engine reads it **explicitly at build**
   (`app.baseURL: process.env.NUXT_APP_BASE_URL || '/'`); games flip base via config or
   this env var and get a correctly nested build (verified: whole site under `static/sub/`
   with zero base-escaping requests).
4. **CSS `url()` cannot be base-prefixed** — CSS has no `withBase()`. Any CSS-referenced
   asset (fonts, textures) must be a **relative** `url()` next to the CSS (Vite emits it
   hashed under the base) — never an absolute `public/` path. Absolute `/fonts/*` is a
   silent 404 under a subpath.
5. **Git-layer consumers prune the engine's `devDependencies` and skip its lifecycle
   scripts.** Anything a consumer's build needs must be a runtime `dependency` or a
   **committed artifact** (that's why the neutral fonts are committed and there is no
   `postinstall`). **And the install is opt-in:** the extend entry MUST be
   `['github:…#tag', { install: true }]` — a bare string clones the layer with NO
   node_modules at all and the engine's runtime deps fail to resolve (verified in the
   Phase-3 remote-layer check; the 2XKO app is the reference).
6. **Internal SSR/prerender `$fetch` cannot read the app's own `public/`** — it falls
   through to the router catch-all and resolves `null` (plus a router warning). Hence:
   registries get **provided/bundled** (Phase-2 API, PLAN §2.4) for real prerendered HTML;
   pure client fetches are marked `server: false`.
7. **`server:false` data + SSR'd conditionals = hydration mismatch.** The server renders
   the no-data branch, the client's first render disagrees. Wrap client-fetched result
   subtrees in `<ClientOnly>` (with a fallback) — as `app/pages/index.vue` does.
8. **`nuxt dev` under a subpath base mis-serves Vite fs-path module URLs** (dev-only
   quirk; `/sub/_nuxt/home/...` 404s). Validate subpath behavior on the **generated**
   output (`verify-subpath.mjs`), never on the dev server.
9. **Headless verification:** `puppeteer-core` drives `/usr/bin/google-chrome-stable`;
   port 3000 may be held by another dev server (Nuxt auto-bumps) — read the actual port
   from the dev log before browser runs.
10. **The remote-layer cache receives a prod-deps-only install**, so modules the engine
    declares in `modules` (`@nuxt/eslint`) resolve from the **consumer's** `node_modules`
    — every consuming repo must carry them in its own `devDependencies`. A missing one is
    a **hard build error** (module resolution fails), not a degraded lint. This is why the
    §1 devDependencies table is a **replication contract** for new repos, not just a
    reference.
11. **Gate hygiene.** Every piped gate runs under `set -o pipefail` (or reads
    `PIPESTATUS[0]`) — `$?` after a pipe measures the last pipe stage, not the checker.
    Before trusting any green gate, run its **positive control** once: inject a known
    failure (a type error for typecheck, a broken assertion for tests, an unused var for
    lint) and confirm the gate exits non-zero, then confirm the clean run exits 0.
    Canonical since the Phase-1 close-out, where an unpiped `$?` reported `tail`'s exit
    as the typechecker's.
12. **`nuxt.options.appConfig` does NOT contain `app/app.config.ts`** (verified
    empirically) — at build time it only carries `appConfig` set inside nuxt.config
    files. Build-time consumers of GameConfig (the static-artifacts module) must re-merge
    the layer app configs themselves (jiti-import each layer's `app/app.config.*` with a
    `defineAppConfig` shim, defu in layer order — `loadMergedGameConfig()` is the
    reference implementation).
13. **App theme files MUST wrap their tokens in plain unlayered `:root`, never
    `@theme`.** A consuming app's `css:` stylesheet does not enter the engine's Tailwind
    root compile, so a raw `@theme` at-rule ships to the browser uncompiled and is
    silently dropped — production wears the umbrella defaults while `nuxt dev` (per-file
    CSS compile) looks correct. Caught live on 2XKO by the Phase-4 audit (v0.4.1);
    Tekken shipped `:root` from day one. Unlayered `:root` beats the engine's
    `@layer theme` defaults in every build mode. Gated by `scripts/verify-override.mjs`
    (built fixture bundle, both directions) and by each game's e2e theme-presence test
    against its own built output.

## 6. Landed in Phase 2 (v0.1.0) — and what remains game-side

Everything §6 previously listed as "arriving" has landed and is locked in §1/§2:
anime.js 4.5.0 · seo plugin + useSiteMeta/useJsonLd · registry provisioning · the
ReplayDB umbrella theme (teal `#17CFC8` / gold `#FBC318`, Space Grotesk) · the `Brand*`
family (BrandMark, BrandSpinner, BrandLogo, BrandWordmark) · game-panel extension slots ·
static artifacts (sitemap/robots/manifest/designed-404).

**Semantic token additions (v0.1.0), all game-overridable** — full list in the README
theme contract: `--color-secondary`, `--color-danger/-warning/-success`,
`--color-surface-sunken` (inset tracks/inputs), `--color-text-secondary` +
`--color-text-faint` (the ported four-tier text ramp), `--color-primary-hover`.
Structural additions: the real product cut geometry (`cut-xs/sm/md/lg` +
`cut-bl-sm/md/lg`), `--ease-snap`, the display type scale
(`hero/d1/d2/title/sub/body/data-xl/label`).

**Contract additions (v0.1.0, all optional/additive):** `Replay.durationSec?`,
`GameConfig.manifest?` (`themeColor`/`backgroundColor`), `GameConfig.ogImage?`, and the
`KnownStats` well-known stats keys (types/stats.ts). Well-known `extra` key:
`aliases: string[]` on Character/Player (search + badge initials).

**Explicitly NOT in the engine (game-side, Phase 3):** the 2XKO fuse system (useFuses,
Fuse* components, fuse dev pages) — plugs into the extension slots; per-game themes
(2XKO neon pink/cyan + Chakra Petch arrive as 2XKO's own theme.css).

---

## 7. v0.2.0 — Phase-3 contract additions (all optional/additive)

Driven by the 2XKO refactor's parity gates (the live site's indexed URLs, visible
vocabulary, and duo-queue data could not ride the v0.1.0 contract):

- **`GameConfig.terms?`** (`character/characters/side/patch/patches/source`, lowercase) —
  every user-visible engine noun (nav, headings, filter labels, search placeholder, SEO
  strings, JSON-LD breadcrumbs, 404 copy) resolves through `useGameTerms()`; labels
  capitalize at the call site with `capWord()`. 2XKO: champion/champions · team ·
  season/seasons · channel. Defaults preserve v0.1.0 output byte-for-byte.
- **`GameConfig.characterRouteSegment?`** — the characters section's URL segment
  (default `characters`). The engine's `engineCharacterRoutes` inline module renames
  `/characters*` page routes via `pages:extend` at build, and every engine link resolves
  through `useGameTerms().characterPath` / `.charactersBase` — so 2XKO keeps its live,
  indexed `/champions/*` URLs with zero page-file duplication. Build-time GameConfig
  resolution is shared with static-artifacts via `modules/game-config.ts`
  (`loadMergedGameConfig`).
- **`Side.players?: string[]`** — a side that is a team of PEOPLE (2XKO duo queue,
  tournament sets; 321 live videos). `player` stays the primary (= `players[0]`).
  `utils/filterReplays.sidePlayers()` is the single accessor: the player facet, search
  haystack, derived options, related-replay affinity, player pages, and card/modal
  labels (joined `' + '`, featured-if-any) all cover every listed player. An empty
  `player` with no `players` yields no people (junk-data sides never enter the player
  facet). Covered in `test:filters` ("Side.players" section).

---

## 8. v0.3.0 — game-defined filter facets + replay badge slots (all additive)

Driven by Phase 3.5 (the 2XKO fuse surface is a launch-advertised feature the generic
Browse could not carry):

- **Game facets** — `provideGameFacets([...])` (app plugin; module-scope holder like the
  registries, `app/utils/gameFacets.ts`). A facet = `{ param, label, note?, chips
(id/label/accent?), matches(selected, { replay, state }), chipLabel? }`. The engine
  renders facet rows in FilterBar/FilterDrawer with the standard chip anatomy
  (accent diamond + accent-tinted active state), wires `param` into URL state / deep
  links / ActiveChips / Clear all / filterKey, and applies predicates inside the pure
  core (`filterReplays(…, gameFacets)` — AND across facets; within-facet semantics are
  the game's). The predicate context carries the **whole FilterState**, so cross-facet
  composition (the promised "fuse on the same side as the selected characters") needs
  no further engine change. Facet `param` is a public URL contract — a game restoring a
  shipped filter keeps its old deep links by reusing the shipped param name (2XKO:
  `fuse`). Covered in `test:filters` ("game-defined facets" section).
- **Positioned stats anchors (v0.4.0)** — the stats page invokes `GameStatsPanels`
  at THREE anchors, passing `position: 'after-usage' | 'beside-timeline' | 'bottom'`:
  a naked full-width row under the usage panel, the Meta-over-time grid's second
  cell (naked; only when the timeline renders), and the original wrapped bottom
  slot. **Overrides must branch on `position`** or their content renders at every
  anchor (the fixtures dummy shows the pattern). Restores the shipped 2XKO stats
  composition (Fuse usage 2nd, Fuse meta beside the timeline) — found in the
  Phase-3.5 preview review, where bottom-stacked fuse panels left half-empty rows.
- **Replay badge slots** — empty same-path-override components:
  `GameReplayBadges.vue` (`replay`, `context: 'card' | 'modal'`) rendered naked between
  a card's matchup and players rows and below the modal's sides block (the
  center/UNBOUND strip — attribution unknown); `GameSideBadge.vue` (`replay`,
  `side: 0|1`, `context`, `compact?`) rendered inside each modal side block under the
  player line (per-side chips — attribution known; `compact` = the mobile variant).
  Overrides own their full markup, so unused slots cost zero pixels (fixture output
  verified stable).

---

## 9. v0.4.1 — theme-contract hardening (docs/tests only; zero runtime change)

Consumers stay pinned at `v0.4.0` — nothing a game imports or renders changed.

- The theme override contract now **mandates plain unlayered `:root`** for app theme
  files (README "Theme override contract"; §5.13). Cause: the 2XKO Phase-4 audit found
  the production bundle shipping a raw `@theme` block — dropped by the browser, so the
  live site wore the umbrella teal/Space Grotesk while `nuxt dev` looked correct.
- `scripts/verify-override.mjs` reworked accordingly: it now **builds the fixtures app
  and probes the generated bundle's computed styles in BOTH directions** — the committed
  fixture override (`fixtures/app/assets/theme.css`, `:root` form, wired through the
  same `css:` array a game uses) must win, and emptying it must fall back to the
  umbrella — plus a raw-`@theme` tripwire over every emitted stylesheet. The old form
  probed a dev server carrying a temporary theme: exactly the mode that masks this bug.
  It also asserted stale pre-Phase-2 values (`--color-surface #131519`, `--cut-md`
  `0.875rem`), so it had not been re-run since the umbrella port — treat verify scripts
  whose expectations drift as unrun, not as passing.
- **Recorded recommendation — replays.json `thumb` omission (emitter contract, future
  minor).** The 2XKO audit measured **all 2,921** emitted `thumb` values as the
  id-derivable `https://i.ytimg.com/vi/<id>/maxresdefault.jpg` (~180 KB ≈ 16% of the
  1.1 MB payload). Emitters could omit pattern-derivable thumbs entirely **if** the
  engine's client fallback chain tried `maxresdefault` → `hqdefault` on error — today
  `BrowseCard`/`VideoModal` derive `hqdefault` only, so omission would silently
  downgrade card/modal art. That fallback is a runtime change, deliberately **not** in
  v0.4.1; until it lands, emitters keep writing explicit `thumb` URLs.

---

## 10. v0.5.1 — static-artifacts under a subpath base (Phase-5 blocker fix)

The first-ever subpath game build (Tekken `/tekken/`, Phase 5) hard-failed in
`modules/static-artifacts.ts`. Two empirical nitro conventions the module had
conflated (invisible at base `/`, where all prior builds ran):

- **Filesystem:** nitro's static presets template `output.publicDir` WITH the base
  (`vercel-static` → `.vercel/output/static/{{ baseURL }}`) and write prerendered
  routes de-based beneath it — so `publicDir` already IS the base directory.
  Re-applying `withBase()` to a filesystem path doubled the base
  (`static/tekken/tekken/…`): sitemap + manifest landed at the doubled path and the
  404-copy probe threw. Fix: artifacts write to `publicDir` directly; `404.html`
  goes to the **static root** (base segments stripped) — Vercel's 404 lookup ignores
  the base.
- **Route strings:** nitro's `prerender:route` hook yields **mixed-space** strings —
  each route keeps the form it ENTERED the queue in (module seeds + crawled hrefs:
  base-prefixed; `x-nitro-prerender` payload/manifest routes: router-space). Only
  `fileName` is uniformly de-based. The module now normalizes with
  `withoutBase()` **before dedupe/exclusion**, and re-bases `<loc>`s with
  `withBase()` at emit — otherwise a subpath sitemap emits duplicate `<loc>`s and
  the `/health`/`/not-found` exclusions miss the prefixed forms.

Verified: fixtures at `/sub/` (artifacts single-based, deduped, exclusions hold,
designed 404 at static root) and at `/` (byte-identical placement to v0.5.0 —
root behavior unchanged); `test:filters` / `test:registry` / typecheck / lint green.
`scripts/verify-subpath.mjs` predates this module and never probed artifacts — its
gap is what let this ship; extending it with an artifacts-placement assertion is the
recorded follow-up.
